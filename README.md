# Lending Club Case Study

## Purpose
Identify risky loan applicants to cut down the amount of credit loss using EDA

## Approach
- Read the data
- Treat missing values (drop columns & rows or impute values)
- Feature Selection (select important columns for analysis)
- perform univairate, segmented univariate and bivariate analysis 
- add visualizations for improved understanding of the data and for presenting the information in a neat manner
- draw conclusions such that the loss of the organisation is minimized
    - don't provide loans to applications which are likely to default
    - should provide load to people who are likely to repay (not doing so will be considered a loss as well)
